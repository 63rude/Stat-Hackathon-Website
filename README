# Bot Interface – JavaScript Frontend

This is the web interface for our chatbot, developed in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

⚠️ **Note:** This frontend is designed to run locally and interact with a **Python backend built with FastAPI**, which contains the logic and trained model. Some features (like the **"Run" button**) will not work unless the backend is running.

---

## 💡 Overview

- Simple chatbot interface to send and receive messages.
- Communicates with a local FastAPI backend via HTTP.
- Backend handles natural language processing and response logic.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- The **"Run"** button triggers a request to the FastAPI backend.
- If the backend is not running, actions like sending a message will not work.
- This repository **does not include the Python backend**.
